# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is focused on building and evaluating a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, which makes the task challenging and highlights the importance of using appropriate metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Build a machine learning model using **Logistic Regression** to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
- Evaluate the model using different metrics like **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, and **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**.
- Explore the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets and demonstrate how they affect model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset, which contains information about transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small proportion of transactions being labeled as fraudulent.

### Key Features:

- **Transaction Amount**: Amount of the transaction.
- **Transaction Time**: Time of the transaction.
- **Features V1-V28**: Anonymized features describing the transaction (not revealed for privacy reasons).
- **Class**: Target variable, where 1 represents a fraud and 0 represents a non-fraud.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
